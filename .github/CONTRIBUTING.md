## Submitting a Pull Request

We love PRs from any unaffiliated contributors. We accept **mostly** bugfixes and new features. The [issue-tracker](https://github.com/NotMarx/Belfast/issues) is the best place to find plenty issues that you can work on. Please keep in mind that if your PR are **New Features** related, you're required to open an issue for discussion before opening a PR or it'll likely rejected. 

Here are the things to remember before start contributing:

- **Make sure you're familiar with TypeScript, the Discord API, and your development environment.**

Every PRs are necessary to be reviewed and approved by the **Affiliated Developers** before on merging thus, it's very important for you to get familiar with the TypeScript programming language and the Discord API itself (or get familiar with the Discord API library we're using, [Detritus](https://github.com/detritusjs/client)) to kept the certain quality of the code base.

- **Always test and recheck your code**

When implementing new feautures of bugfixes, a testing is required to avoid any code typo/lack of features when we're reviewing your PR or it's likely to be rejected. If you want to make a major changes within the project, we highly recommend you to open an [issue](https://github.com/NotMarx/Belfast/issues/new) with your relevant intentions before you spend too much time on a wasted effort.
